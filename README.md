he Snowman Puzzle has the following formal description. Read the description carefully. • The puzzle is played on a board that is a grid board with N squares in the x-dimension and M squares in the y-dimension. • Each state contains x and y coordinates for the robot, the snowballs, the destination point for the snowman, and the obstacles. • Each board initially will contains three snowballs: a small, medium and large snowball. • From each state, the robot can move Up, Down, Left, or Right. If a robot moves to the location of an unobstructed snowball, the snowball will move one square in the same direction. Snowballs and the robot cannot pass through walls or obstacles, however. • The robot cannot push more than one snowball at a time. If two snowballs are in succession and the robot is adjacent to the smaller of the two, the robot may push the smaller snowball atop the larger one.  However, the robot cannot push a large snowball atop a smaller one, nor can the robot move a stack of snowballs.  Movements that cause a snowball to travel more than.one unit of the grid are also illegal. • Each movement is of equal cost.  Whether or not the robot is pushing an snowball does not change the cost. • The goal is achieved when there is a stack of three snowballs on the game board and in the destination spot. This stack must have a large snowball on the bottom, a medium sized snowball in the middle, and a small snowball at the top.
